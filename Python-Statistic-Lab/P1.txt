1)	Extract a dataset of your choice and compute the correlation between any two variables and visualize the relationship using scatter plot using JMP Pro tool.

The tools used are JMP Pro

The correlation is a measure on the linear association between two variables

The correlation between two variables;

The steps required to perform scatter plot in JMP pro are:

1)	Open JMP Pro data table, select Analyze, fit Y by X.
2)	Click on a continuous variable from select columns and click Y response( continuous variables have blue triangles)
3)	Click on a second continuous variable and click X, and click OK to generate a scatter plot.
4)	To display the correlation, click on the red triangle and select the density eclipse> 0.55
 
 


Correlation between multiple pair of variables

1)	Select analyze , and click on multivariate methods and atleast click on multivariate
2)	Click on two or more continuous variables from select columns with density ellipse and table of correlation
3)	Click OK to produce a scatter plot matrix with density ellipse and table of correlations
