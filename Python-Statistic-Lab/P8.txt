8)	Analyze a dataset containing information about the sales revenue and advertising expenditure of a company over a period of time. Calculate the Karl Pearson correlation coefficient between sales revenue and advertising expenditure using Python. Interpret the correlation coefficient and discuss the strength and direction of the relationship between advertising and sales.

# Extract sales revenue and advertising expenditure columns

advertising_expenditure = data['Advertising_exp(millions)']

# Calculate the Karl Pearson correlation coefficient
correlation_coefficient, p_value = pearsonr(sales_revenue, advertising_expenditure)
