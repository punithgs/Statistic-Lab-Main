3)	Select any dataset from JMP Pro tool and perform ANOVA test and Non- Parametric tests (The Mann Whitney test and The Kruskal-Wallis test).

One- way annova
 Steps:

1)	Select analyze> fit y by x
2)	Click on a continuous variable from select columns and click y response
3)	Click on a categorical variable and click x vector(variable have red or green bars)
4)	Click ok
5)	Click on red triangle
6)	The null hypotheses is here and between the population means
7)	Prob> F is p-value for whole model test since prob> F is less than 0.05, reject hypothesis on equal means


            Two-way annova
 
1)	Select analyze> fir model
2)	Click on a continuous variable from select columns and click y, response
3)	Click on two categorical variables from select columns and click macros, categorical(red or green)
4)	Alternative hypothesis doesnâ€™t have an affect


          Kruskals test

1)	Select analyse> fit y by x
2)	Continuous variable and categorical variable
3)	Click ok, JMP will display the  dropbox
4)	Click on triangle go to the non-parametric test
5)	Select x variable has 3 variables then we perform kruskal Wallis test
