6)	Perform univariate analysis on a dataset containing information about the performance of students in a school. The dataset includes variables such as student ID, test scores in different subjects, attendance, and socio-economic background. Use Python to analyze the distribution of test scores in each subject separately. Calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation for each subject and visualize the distribution using box plots. 

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Read the dataset
data = pd.read_csv("C:\\Users\\ASUS\\Downloads\\student_performance_dataset.csv")  # Replace "student_performance_dataset.csv" with the actual file name
# Analyze test scores in different subjects
subjects = ['math', 'science', 'english']  # Add more subjects if needed
for subject in subjects:
    subject_scores = data[subject]
    # Calculate descriptive statistics
    mean_score = np.mean(subject_scores)
    median_score = np.median(subject_scores)
    std_score = np.std(subject_scores)

    # Visualize the distribution using a box plot
    plt.boxplot(subject_scores)
    plt.xlabel(subject.capitalize() + " Score")
    plt.ylabel("Score")
    plt.title("Distribution of " + subject.capitalize() + " Scores")
    plt.show()

    # Print the results
    print(subject.capitalize() + " Scores:")
    print("Mean:", mean_score)
    print("Median:", median_score)
    print("Standard Deviation:", std_score)
    print()
